Tails Story Planner App
=======================

Tails is an app designed to help you plan your stories - or 'tales' - being a
budding author that just wants somewhere to stash ideas and details.

**Please be aware this app is still in development**

Installation
------------

This app uses a MEAN stack so it will require `node` and `bower` to be installed
as well as following these steps:

1. Install npm modules `npm install`
2. Install bower components `bower install`

Usage
-----

Hopefully it is pretty self-explanatory for the most part. But this app does run
on a node server so you will need to open a terminal and type the following to
make the site available:

``` node server.js ```

Once the server is up and running, the site runs from port `7411`, so you can
access the site from this url:

``` http://localhost:7411 ```
